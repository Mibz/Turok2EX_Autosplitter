# Turok2EX_Autosplitter
Autosplitter for Turok 2 PC Remaster featuring auto start, reset, and end. Now 100% more autosplitty!

Following instructions paraphrased from GrowthKasei of twitch.tv/growthkasei (current record holder of Any% and 100%)

1. Download Livesplit 1.7.6 
2. Launch it as Admin (Important) 
3. Create a completely new file and create fresh new splits.
4. Right-click the Livesplit window and hit Edit Splits, make sure the game title is: Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Remastered And the category is named Any% 
5. Make sure that the Autosplitter functionality is ACTIVATED in the Edit Splits section.
6. Create 9 new splits, and name them whatever you want, then save.

Every time you launch Livesplit, make sure you do so as an Admin and start Turok 2. The game should now split automatically.
